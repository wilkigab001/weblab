                One of the most popular places to go mountain biking in utah is in little cottonwood canyon. Most of these tracks range from easy to difficult, but because they are in a  canyon most tracks are strictly downhill. Meanwhile there is a center path so that you can get to all of the trails!

            There are mountain biking parks all over utah valley especially. Some notable ones are found in Eagle Mountain, Draper, Alpine, Provo Canyon, and Pleasant Grove. You can bet that if the city is sitting at the base of the mountain they will have at least 1 well-maintained trail.

       <p>Do you not know what kind of bike you want to get? For starters you should invest into a hardtail bike. They are typically cheaper because they don't have rear suspension. If you really begin taking a liking to mountain biking I would recommend investing into a bike with full suspension! At that point they will definitely be worth the money and you will see quite the difference in your riding style!</p>
